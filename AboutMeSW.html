                <h2>Wondering how to make technology less confusing and more helpful?</h2>
                Reid Carter is a high school junior at John Burroughs School with a passion for helping seniors become more confident with technology. Through his program in Saint Louis, MO, Reid visits local senior living facilities to give presentations on technology that can improve everyday life, answer questions, and provide hands-on guidance tailored to each individual's needs.

                “<a style="color: rgb(7, 142, 232);" href="MissionSW.html">No request is a burden,</a>”
                reflects his belief that seniors should never feel hesitant about asking for help, Reid's goal is always to make technology accessible, understandable, and enjoyable. He currently works with five facilities in the St. Louis area and is actively looking to expand to more locations to reach even more seniors.
