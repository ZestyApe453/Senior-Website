    Hey, I'm Reid Carter.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for signing up! You're on the list and you'll start receiving my 
    new technology newsletter every Thursday. Each message includes 3 posts I 
    have written over the past week about emerging scams you should avoid, 
    interesting new technology, and online safety tips. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In this first email I want to tell you 3 things:
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>1. Make sure my emails can reach your Inbox</strong></h3>
    If an email ever doesn't show up, check your "spam" or "all mail" folders. To ensure this never happens, you can whitelist me with the simple instruction on <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/whitelisting/#apple" target="_blank">this page</a> (it has screenshots)
    
    <h3><strong>2. This newsletter builds on my live presentations, but is still valuable on its own</strong></h3>
    Every few weeks I visit various Senior Living Facilities in the Saint Louis area to give residents presentations on topics ranging from changing smartphone wallpaper to pictures of their
    grandkids to explaning the benefits of Artificial Intelligence in their daily lives. Many of the messages in this newsletter are inspired by suggestions residents have given to me, but have the
    potential to benefit anybody. 

    <h3><strong>3. View all past iterations on my website</strong></h3>
    After sending out each newsletter, I copy the post onto my website <a href="https://reidstechtips.com" target="_blank">reidstechtips.com</a> for you to view at any time. Also, feel free to email any suspicious emails to reid@reidstechtips.com. I'll verify it, and get back to you as soon as possible.
