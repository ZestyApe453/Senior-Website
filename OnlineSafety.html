                Scammers are constantly finding new ways to reach you, and text messages have become one of their favorite tools. These messages often look like they're from banks, delivery services, or even friends, but their goal is the same: steal your information or money.
                <br>
                <br>
                One common approach involves urgency. Scammers will claim your account is at risk or that you have a limited-time offer. The goal is to make you act without thinking. Real companies rarely demand immediate action through a text, and they won't ask for passwords or Social Security numbers over SMS.
                <br>
                <br>
                Red flags also include unusual spelling, grammar mistakes, or messages from numbers you don't recognize. When in doubt, ignore the text and contact the company or person directly using official channels. Staying alert and skeptical is the simplest way to protect yourself from these increasingly sophisticated schemes.
